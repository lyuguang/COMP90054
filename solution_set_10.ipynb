        "- In order to use a greedy (or $\\epsilon$-greedy) policy defined over a value function, we must able to compute the maximum over all the possible actions. In a continuous action space, this may be computationally prohibitive to do, as it is itself an entire optimisation problem. Instead, we can simple discretise the action space into a discrete one, but this suffers from two main downsides. Firstly, you lose the ability to perform very precise control. Secondly, due to the 'curse of dimensionality', even a relatively coarse discretisation will blow up to an infeasible number of actions if the dimensions of the action space is large. For example in a robotic setting with 27 motors controlling different joints, even discretising to only 5 possible values would result in $5^{27} = 7.5e18$ actions.\n",
        "Instead, policy based methods directly produce an action without having to calculate the maximum. In a continuous setting, this is often done by having $f(s,a)^\\top \\theta$ give the mean of a normal distribution, which is then sampled to return the action.\n",
        "\n",
        "- The first key change is clipping the gradient so that the weights do not change too far in a single step. This helps to mitigate bias due to the Advantage function - if the policy suddenly changes a lot, then the value-estimates trained on the old policy may be quite unreliable, and this introduces a bias into the update steps. Second, experience is collected and then repeatedly trained over in mini-batches (like batch methods in value-approximation RL). This is only possible due to the clipped gradient as otherwise repeated training tends to be unstable. Note that these are largely empirical results - there is minimal theoretical basis for these choices, they just turn out to work well in practice.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Having entropy included in the loss function is a way of encouraging exploration. Unlike in value-based methods, policy-approximation methods can not just use an epsilon-greedy policy to encourage exploration. Instead, having an entropy term discourages the policy from converging to a an overly concentrated distribution, ensuring that a variety of actions are still chosen."
